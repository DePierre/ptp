# PTP

Pentester's tools parser provides an unified way to retrieve the information
from all (final goal) automated pentesting tools.

# General

This standalone library is created in order to be used by
[OWTF](https://github.com/owtf) when it will try to retrieve the automated
rankings already provided by some pentesting tools.

# Current support

None.
